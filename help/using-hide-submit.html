The <a href='/project/hide_submit'>hide_submit module</a> provides a way to hide the submit button in a form after it has been clicked.  This will indicate 

to the user that his or her request is being processed and helps to prevent duplicate postings from impatient "double clickers".

To achieve this effect a small jQuery snippet is used and is injected to selected (configurable) pages. This script will hide the submit button after it has 

been clicked and will replace it with an informative text such as "Please wait..." and/or an animated indicator.

<h2>Features</h2>

  <li>Hide the submit button after it has been clicked</li>

</ul>
